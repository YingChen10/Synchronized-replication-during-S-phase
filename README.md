# Synchronized-replication-during-S-phase
Genes sensitive to the stoichiometric relationships, such as those encoding the same protein complex, are replicated simultaneously in mammalian cells to keep the dosage balance among them.

This code includes all the code and data to generate the figures in the paper entitled: "Synchronized replication of genes encoding the same protein complex driven by the demand for dosage balance during S phase"
