# Synchronized-replication-during-S-phase
Genes sensitive to the stoichiometric relationships, such as those encoding the same protein complex, are replicated simultaneously in mammalian cells to keep the dosage balance among them.

This code includes all the code and data to generate the figures in the paper entitled: "Poor codon optimality as a signal to degrade transcripts with frameshift"
